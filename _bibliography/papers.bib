  abstract={{Clinically and biologically valuable information may reside untapped in large cancer gene expression data sets. Deep unsupervised learning has the potential to extract this information with unprecedented efficacy but has thus far been hampered by a lack of biological interpretability and robustness. Here, we present DeepProfile, a comprehensive framework that addresses current challenges in applying unsupervised deep learning to gene expression profiles. We use DeepProfile to learn low-dimensional latent spaces for 18 human cancers from 50,211 transcriptomes. DeepProfile outperforms existing dimensionality reduction methods with respect to biological interpretability. Using DeepProfile interpretability methods, we show that genes that are universally important in defining the latent spaces across all cancer types control immune cell activation, while cancer type-specific genes and pathways define molecular disease subtypes. By linking DeepProfile latent variables to secondary tumor characteristics, we discover that tumor mutation burden is closely associated with the expression of cell cycle-related genes. DNA mismatch repair and MHC class II antigen presentation pathway expression, on the other hand, are consistently associated with patient survival. We validate these results through Kaplan-Meier analyses and nominate tumor-associated macrophages as an important source of survival-correlated MHC class II transcripts. Our results illustrate the power of unsupervised deep learning for discovery of novel cancer biology from existing gene expression data.}},

  abstract={{Health literacy has emerged as a crucial factor in making appropriate health decisions and ensuring treatment outcomes. However, medical jargon and the complex structure of professional language in this domain make health information especially hard to interpret. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for automated methods to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature to the general population. This problem can be framed as a type of translation problem between the language of healthcare professionals, and that of the general public. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of automated generation of lay language summaries of biomedical scientific reviews, and construct a dataset to support the development and evaluation of automated methods through which to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature. We conduct analyses of the various challenges in performing this task, including not only summarization of the key points but also explanation of background knowledge and simplification of professional language. We experiment with state-of-the-art summarization models as well as several data augmentation techniques, and evaluate their performance using both automated metrics and human assessment. Results indicate that automatically generated summaries produced using contemporary neural architectures can achieve promising quality and readability as compared with reference summaries developed for the lay public by experts (best ROUGE-L of 50.24 and Flesch-Kincaid readability score of 13.30). We also discuss the limitations of the current effort, providing insights and directions for future work.}},
