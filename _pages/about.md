I am a final year PhD student at the [Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at University of Washington supervised by [Su-In Lee](https://suinlee.cs.washington.edu/). I will be joining the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at Rice University as an Assistant Professor starting in January 2026. Before my PhD, I earned a BS in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Yuanpei College, Peking University. Please see my [CV](https://qiuweipku.github.io/cv/) for more information.

## Research Focus
Our research focuses broadly on **AI for Biomedicine**, developing and applying advanced machine learning techniques to tackle fundamental challenges in biology and healthcare. We are particularly interested in:  
1. **Aging and Age-related Diseases:** Using AI to explore the mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases through multi-modality data modeling, aiming to uncover actionable biological insights and inform precision medicine.  
2. **Interpretable and Trustworthy Biomedical AI:** Developing explainable AI (XAI) methods to enhance the transparency, interpretability, and reliability of AI systems for biomedical research and clinical applications.  
3. **Foundation Models for Biomedical Data:** Leveraging foundation models to integrate diverse biomedical data modalities and address complex problems in biology and healthcare.
