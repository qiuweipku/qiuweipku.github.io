I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at Rice University, with a joint appointment in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.rice.edu/). I received my PhD from the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at the University of Washington, where I was advised by [Su-In Lee](https://suinlee.cs.washington.edu/). Before my PhD, I earned a BS in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Yuanpei College, Peking University. Please see my [CV](https://qiuweipku.github.io/cv/) for more information.

**I am recruiting a postdoc (Spring 2026), two PhD students (Fall 2026), and students at all levels for research opportunities — please reach out if you are interested, and see the details in the [lab openings](#lab-openings).**


### research focus
Our research focuses broadly on **AI for Biomedicine**, developing and applying advanced machine learning techniques to tackle fundamental challenges in biology and healthcare. We are particularly interested in:  
1. **Aging and Age-related Diseases:** Using AI to explore the mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases through multi-modality data modeling, aiming to uncover actionable biological insights and inform precision medicine.  
2. **Foundation Models for Biomedical Data:** Leveraging foundation models to integrate diverse biomedical data modalities and address complex problems in biology and healthcare.  
3. **Interpretable and Trustworthy Biomedical AI:** Developing explainable AI (XAI) methods to enhance the transparency, interpretability, and reliability of AI systems for biomedical research and clinical applications.
