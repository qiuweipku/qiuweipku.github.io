I am a final year PhD student at the [Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at University of Washington supervised by [Su-In Lee](https://suinlee.cs.washington.edu/). Before my PhD, I earned BSs in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Yuanpei College, Peking University. Please see my [CV](https://qiuweipku.github.io/cv/) for more information.

My research interest involves utilizing machine learning to explore the mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases, as well as to conduct single-cell data analysis and genomics studies. Additionally, I am engaged in the development and application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, aiming to enhance transparency and efficacy in biomedical and healthcare settings.
